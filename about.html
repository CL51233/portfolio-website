    <h2>Welcome to My Journey!</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm a passionate programmer with over 12 years of experience in coding, game development, and graphic design. My journey began with block coding through Scratch and Mbot competitions, where I showcased projects at international Maker Faires. These experiences broadened my view of technology and ignited my passion for solving problems creatively.</p>

    <p>In high school, I expanded my skills in Python, JavaScript, and Unreal Engine. My key projects include a <strong>Voice Assistant</strong> and a <strong>Text-Based RPG Game</strong>, both of which are highlighted on this website. These projects have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, with a focus on user experience and software development.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am studying Software Development at Edinburgh College, where I am enhancing my expertise in databases and web development using Django. I am also about to begin a work placement with CGI, where I look forward to applying my skills in a real-world setting and learning from industry professionals.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy playing the piano (Grade 2) and have taken on a leadership role as the captain of my schoolâ€™s badminton team. As I continue my journey in technology, I am eager to focus on game development and software engineering, building creative and impactful projects.</p>
